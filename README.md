# Tactician Mod

Robin, known as Fire Emblem's best tactician from Ylisse, enters Slay the Spire as an unofficial, modded character.

Use weapon types to turn the tides of battle. With weapon advantage, you can deal more damage, gain more Block, and
halve consumption of your consumable counter-attack power.  Enemy actions are tied to a weapon type. Can you ascend the Spire with your wits?

# Features

This mod is still in development, but once complete this character will feature:
- A full set of 75 non-Strike/Defend cards.
- 13 relics, 8 of which are global.
- 4 potions, 2 of which are global.

# Progress

Almost every card is working as intended, but the implementation of weapon types is complicated.
Card art will consist of screenshots mostly from Fire Emblem Awakening, as well as Three Houses, Heroes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

# Legal Notice

Fire Emblem is a property owned by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems. I make no attempt at owning nor controlling this IP,
and this project does not attempt to portray itself as official content. This mod is exclusive to the PC release of
Slay the Spire, which Nintendo has not expressed any intention of any crossover deals with. As a result, this combined
with the lack of an existing release of Fire Emblem Awakening demonstrates that this fan-made work bears no possible
financial burden for any holders of the Fire Emblem brand, copyright, etc.
